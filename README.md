    MY name is Gagandeep.I am from Joginder Nagar HIMACHAL PRADESH. I am 19 years old . currently i am persuing btech in computer science engineering from cgc landran,mohali PUNJAB I am a punctual and studious person because I believe that education is the key to success. Academic excellence could make our careers shine bright. Recently I I can manage my time because my mother taught me that time waits for no one. It is important to make correct use of time to succeed in life. If we value time, then only time will value us. My ambition in life is to become a successful gynaecologist and serve for human society.
Hence, these are the qualities that describe me the best. Though no one can present themselves in a few words still I tried to give a brief about myself through this essay. In my opinion, life is meant to be lived with utmost happiness and an aim to serve humanity. Thus, keep this in mind, I will always try to help others and be the best version of myself.
